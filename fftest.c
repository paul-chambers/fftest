/* Master's SIGCHLD handler.
 *
 * When a process is fork()ed by a process, the new process is an exact copy
 * of the old process, except for a few values, one of which is that the parent
 * pid of the child is that of the process that forked it.
 *
 * When this child exits, the signal SIGCHLD is sent to the parent process to
 * alert it. By default, the signal is ignored, but we can take this opportunity
 * to restart any children that have died.
 *
 * There are many ways to determine which children have died, but the most
 * portable method is to use the wait() family of system calls.
 *
 * A dead child process releases its memory, but sticks around so that any
 * interested parties can determine how they died (exit status). Calling wait()
 * in the master collects the status of the first available dead process, and
 * removes it from the process table.
 *
 * If wait() is never called by the parent, the dead child sticks around as a
 * "zombie" process, marked with status `Z' in ps output. If the parent process
 * exits without ever calling wait, the zombie process does not disappear, but
 * is inherited by the root process (its parent pid is set to 1).
 *
 * Because SIGCHLD is an asynchronous signal, it is possible that if many
 * children die simultaneously, the parent may only notice one SIGCHLD when many
 * have been sent. In order to beat this edge case, we can simply loop through
 * all the known children and call waitpid() in non-blocking mode to see if they
 * have died, and spawn a new one in their place.

 * SIGINT to all children, but this is not true with SIGTERM.
